- waitzombiepid(int pid) function was implemented originally
for the background process shell feature. 
    - implemented in proc.c as a system call
        - changed a bunch of other files to reflect the change as well like headers etc. 
    - it loops through the ptable to look for process with input pid
        - if that process is a zombie, it goes through the reaping process (copied from wait())
        - the difference with the wait() function is that this doesn't do sleep() which is the blocking function
        - so if the process is still running, no other process is blocked to wait for it to finish
- it's my version of waitpid that i implemented.
